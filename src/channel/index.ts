   * That would call a contract with the poster being the caller of it. Poster commits
   * an amount of coins to the contract.

   * The call would also create a call object inside the channel state tree. It contains
   * the result of the contract call.

   * It is worth mentioning that the gas is not consumed, because this is an off-chain
   * contract call. It would be consumed if it were an on-chain one. This could happen
   * if a call with a similar computation amount is to be forced on-chain.
